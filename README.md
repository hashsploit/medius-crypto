# Medius Crypto 

Library to encrypt and decrypt PS2 and PS3 Medius messages.

Ported over from the [original project](https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/medius-crypto) in C#.

Huge thanks to [Dnawrkshp](https://github.com/Dnawrkshp) for reversing Medius for PS2/PS3.

## To do
- RS3_RC.java is broken, need to find alternative to `BitConverter.GetBytes()` and `BitConverter.ToUInt32()`.
- Missing RSA classes.
